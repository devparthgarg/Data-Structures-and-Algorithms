	>> Stack
	Stack is a data structure designed to operate in LIFO (Last in First out) context.
	In stack elements are inserted as well as get removed from only one end.

	>> Stack Operations
	1.push(x): push `x` into stack
	2.pop(): remove element on top of the stack
	3.size(): returns size of stack
	4.empty(): returns true if stack empty
	5.top(): returns top element of the stack

	note: all above operations take O(1) time.

	>> Stack Errors (when memory not dynamically allocated)
	1.underflow: when top() or pop() called on empty stack
	2.overflow: when push() called on full stack
